Description
Simple_shell is a command line interpreter, or shell, made by us in the tradition of the first Unix shell written by Ken Thompson in 1971. This shell is intentionally minimalistic, was made in order to practice the basics of C learning, yet includes the basic functionality of a traditional Unix-like command line user interface. Standard functions and system calls employed in simple_shell include: access, execve, exit, fork, free, fstat, getline, malloc, perror, signal, stat, wait, write.
